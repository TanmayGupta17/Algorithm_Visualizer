# Algorithm_Visualizer

## Overview
This Python project utilizes Pygame to visualize various sorting algorithms and graph traversal algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of how these algorithms operate on arrays and graphs, allowing users to observe their behavior step-by-step.

## Features
### Sorting Algorithms:

  -> Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort.<br>
  -> Ascending and descending order options.<br>
  
### Graph Traversal:

  -> Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.<br>
  -> Visualization of traversal path and visited nodes.<br>
  
### User Interface:

  -> Interactive UI with keyboard controls.<br>
  -> Switch between sorting algorithms and graph traversal algorithms.<br>
  -> Reset functionality to regenerate arrays and graph structures.<br>
### Additional Features:

  -> Home screen for easy navigation.<br>
  -> Customizable speed control for animation.<br>
  -> Detailed instructions and controls displayed during runtime.<br>
  -> Color-coded visualization for better understanding.<br>
